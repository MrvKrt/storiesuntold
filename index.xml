      <description>Who am I? Nobody, really.
Someone you pass on the road. Someone you have to live with in this world we can&amp;rsquo;t escape from. A friend to some or an enemy to some.
Someone you don&amp;rsquo;t want to remember or someone you wish you knew more? I may be, but I may not be. So don&amp;rsquo;t worry about it too much.
On another birthday eve, with a million thoughts in my head, I opened this secret blog to say that I was here, to see how the years have changed me.</description>

Until I didn’t. It turns out procrastinating caused me to miss deadlines, over and over.</description>

      <description>We spend our days filling in every available space, cramming in more tasks, responding to messages, checking social media and online sites, watching videos.
We are afraid of empty space in our lives.
The result is often a continual busyness, constant distraction and avoidance, lack of focus, lack of satisfaction with our lives.
We run from silence. We run from the spaces between tasks and appointments. We run from solitude and stillness.</description>
